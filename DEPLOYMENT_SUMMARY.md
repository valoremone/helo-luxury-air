# HELO Luxury Air Deployment Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Fixed Dependency Issues**
   - Installed the correct version of react-router-dom (6.22.3)
   - Resolved OpenSSL compatibility issues with Node.js v20+

2. **Configured for Subdirectory Deployment**
   - Added `"homepage": "/app"` to package.json
   - Created .htaccess file for proper routing in the subdirectory

3. **Created Deployment Scripts**
   - deploy-cpanel.sh (for Mac/Linux)
   - deploy-cpanel.bat (for Windows)
   - Both scripts handle the build process and prepare files for upload

4. **Built the Application**
   - Successfully built the React application
   - Created a deployment-ready directory (cpanel-deploy)
   - Generated a ZIP file (cpanel-deploy.zip) for easy upload

5. **Created Documentation**
   - Comprehensive deployment guide (DEPLOYMENT_CPANEL.md)
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - This summary document

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Upload the Files to cPanel**
   - Log in to your cPanel account
   - Navigate to File Manager
   - Go to the public_html directory (or document root)
   - Create an `app` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Upload the contents of cpanel-deploy.zip to the `app` directory
   
   **Option 1: Upload the ZIP file and extract**
   - Upload cpanel-deploy.zip to your server
   - Use cPanel's Extract feature to extract the contents to the `app` directory
   
   **Option 2: Upload individual files**
   - Upload all files and directories from the cpanel-deploy directory to the `app` directory

2. **Verify the Deployment**
   - Visit https://dev.flyhelo.one/app in your browser
   - Test navigation to different pages
   - Ensure all functionality works as expected

## Important Files

- **cpanel-deploy.zip**: Contains all files ready for upload
- **DEPLOYMENT_CPANEL.md**: Detailed deployment instructions
- **BUILD_ERROR_FIX.md**: Solutions for common build errors
- **.htaccess**: Critical for proper routing (already included in cpanel-deploy.zip)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after deployment:

1. **404 Errors When Navigating**
   - Verify the .htaccess file is properly uploaded
   - Check that mod_rewrite is enabled on your server

2. **Application Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify all files were uploaded correctly
   - Ensure the server supports the necessary Apache modules

3. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify API endpoints are correctly configured
   - Check for CORS issues if the API is on a different domain

## Future Updates

When you need to update the application:

1. Make your changes to the codebase
2. Run the deployment script again:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-cpanel.sh  # Mac/Linux
   ```
   or
   ```
   deploy-cpanel.bat  # Windows
   ```
3. Upload the new files to replace the existing ones in cPanel
