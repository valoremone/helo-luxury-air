# GitHub Push Fix

You're encountering an error when pushing to GitHub because of email privacy settings. GitHub is rejecting your push because it would expose your private email address.

## Solution

1. Go to [GitHub Email Settings](https://github.com/settings/emails)
2. Look for the "Keep my email addresses private" section
3. Note your GitHub-provided no-reply email address (it looks like `ID+username@users.noreply.github.com`)
4. Configure Git to use this email address with the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.email "YOUR_ID+YOUR_USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com"
```

5. Reset the author information on your last commit:

```bash
git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit
```

6. Now try pushing again:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

## Alternative Solutions

If you prefer to use your real email address in commits:

1. Go to [GitHub Email Settings](https://github.com/settings/emails)
2. Uncheck "Block command line pushes that expose my email" 
3. Push your changes

Note that this will make your email address visible in public repositories.

## For Future Commits

Your Git configuration will now use the no-reply email address for all future commits, so you won't encounter this issue again.
